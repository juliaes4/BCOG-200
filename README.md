# BCOG-200
# Healthy Breakfast Recipe Finder 

## Project Description
This project is a simple **Flask web application** that helps users find **healthy breakfast recipes** based on ingredients or dietary preferences. Users can enter an ingredient (e.g., "banana" or "oats"), and the app will suggest **matching recipes** with their **nutritional information** (calories, protein, etc.). The goal is to make **meal planning easier** for those looking for healthy food options. This project uses **Flask** for the backend and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend.
