I have several sources for this project, because obviously we didn't learn about flask and HTML files in class
this is stuff I learned through Reddit, Quora, Tumblr, and admittedly, asked chatGPT for pointers (and definitely for aesthetic help-- it's very good at spicing things up) too. 

I'm linking some of the posts and reddit communities I frequented to make this work.

r/flask was a big one. sometimes I just scrolled aimlessly to learn more info
