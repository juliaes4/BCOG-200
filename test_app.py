TEST PLAN

i want to ensure the Healthy Breakfast Finder works correctly when searching for different ingredients or diet tags.

how to test:
1. run the app with: `python3 app.py`
2. go to the given test link through my terminal in my browser
3. try searching for:
   - “banana” (should return banana oatmeal and banana waffles, etc)
   - “vegan” (should return only vegan recipes)
   - “spicy” (should return recipes with spicy flavor tags)

test data:
make sure my `recipes.csv` includes valid headers and rows matching the required format. See README for details.
